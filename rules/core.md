           RPG system with a single d20 and a very straightforward logic. Characters without any
           bonuses can only beat a hard Difficulty Challenge, but someone with focus towards a
           certain aspect can begin to triumph in more difficult, expert or even legendary level
           tasks. A roll of 1 is a critical failure and a roll of 20 a critical success.
           Can be played in MONO (a kind of bird’s-eye), more traditional MULTI, or hybrid mode.
