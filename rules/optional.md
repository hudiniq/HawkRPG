#### Character creation
Pick 3 aspects that the character is good at. The character will roll with advantage on any checks that fall under one of his aspects.  
You can substitute 1 aspect for a profession and/or another for an innate ability.

#### Profession
`10 + Profession BONUS >= DC  ──>  Profession LVL`  
Profession is levelled separately. To advance to the next level, accumulate XP up to the number of current profession level. Gain 1 Profession XP every time a successful check's DC is at least equal to 10 + Profession BONUS.  
A character can try himself in any profession but will roll with disadvantage until he gets some formal training. If the character starts with a profession, it means he already had some training, starts at level 3 and can roll any profession checks without disadvantage.  
For crafting materials need to be obtained. Any special materials or blueprints may contribute advantage or special bonuses to the check.

#### Fortune
`CHK > 20  ──>  1 FP for every point over`  
When you make a check, any point over 20 equals 1 Fortune Point (FP).  
|   1 FP  |    3 FP   |   10 FP  |   50 FP  | 100 FP |
|:-------:|:---------:|:--------:|:--------:|:------:|
| 1G/SUPP | +1 to CHK | 1 reroll | God boon |  Wish  |

#### Divination
Whenever a referee (DM) has a hard time deciding, he can consult the die. Roll a single d20 and interpret the result, to guide your decision. No DC, every die result has its own meaning in the context that it was rolled.
